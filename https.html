<!-- I have taken a beginners course in C#, but I have never coded in html/css before, so bear with me here :) 
     The h1 heading is the word i'm explaning https, I commented in css how i styled it. -->
 <h1> https </h1> 
<!-- here is the first paragraph that explains the word, I use the <b> to make some words "bold" and <i> to make some words cursive
     so you take more notice to the words I want. -->
  <p>While http is the <i>primary protocol</i> used to communicate data between someones computer and the site, 
    or more specifically the webbrowser and a website, <b>https</b> is the more secure version of that. 
    <b>Https</b> stands for <i>Hypertext transfer protocol secure</i>, and what makes it more secure is that its encrypted
    to increase security of data transfers. So if you (or me) ever make a website that requires login credentials 
    i would highly recommend using <b>https</b> over http.</p> 

<!-- Heres the second paragraph where the links is explained and where the CSS classes make the buttons more interactive for the user
     read more about what the do in the css comments. -->
  <p>Now don't just take my word for it, watch <i>"thecuriousengineer"</i> explain it on this new thing called <b>Youtube</b>.<br>-
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0QbnxKRD0w" class="button1">thecuriousengineer</a><br>
     Or the ever trusted <b>Wikipedia</b>.<br>-
    <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_Secure" class="button2">Wikipedia</a><br>
     My personal favorite is the great <i>web development community</i> <b>MDN</b> where alot of problems has been solved throu out the years.<br>-
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/https" class="button3">MDN</a></p>

<!-- So this was my first website I ever created, hopefully you like it. It was alot of fun to learn, to visualize it in my head, then 
google it, learn, then create it, rinse and repeat. And for anyone whos reading this, have a FANTASTIC day! -->
